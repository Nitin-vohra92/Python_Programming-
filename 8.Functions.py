#FUNCTIONS : Piece of codes to modulate the whole program and avoid repeatition of similar line of code.

#To define a function we use the : 'def' keyword:
def helloFunction():
    pass #To leave a fucntion empty we need to write 'pass'. Else it will give error.

print(helloFunction) #Gives the address , where the fucntion is created.
print(helloFunction()) #Call the function , Output : 'None' , as fucntion does not return anything.
print()
